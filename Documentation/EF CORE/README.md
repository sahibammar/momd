# Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core can be used as an O/RM that maps between the relational database and the
.NET world of classes and software code. The folowing table shows how EF Core maps the two
worlds of the relational database and .NET software.
